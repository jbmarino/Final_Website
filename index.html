            <h4>Joseph Marino</h4>
            <p>Hello! This is my final project for my class SI 339: Web Design, Development, and Accessibility.
            I have decided to create a collection of music from the 60s to 90s that have impacted me.
            Music is a story because it is a reflection of the artist and of the listeners personal emotions & feelings.
